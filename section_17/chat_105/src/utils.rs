// standard libraries from trait to the type we implemented (ChatError)
//
// We use send and sync bounds to ensure that if a task that is spawned
// on another thread fails, it will be able to safely report the failure
// up to main.
// And if it doesn't, you'll be able to see it a little bit more as we
// continue our program.


// So the function we are going to create is going to create a
// JSON representation of our packet as a string.
// Then we will add a new line to the end of the string and write it all to leaving.

// One generic type is going to implement the asynchronous buff, read and Unpin
// Our other generic type is going t need to make sure the serialized owned is
// implemented, which is the reason we are doing this is.
// So that our serialized values being returned to our caller a/k/a the client,
// need to outlive the buffer we are getting our messages from..
// So serialized own is always going to be independent from the buffer,
// which means we will satisfy that requirement.

// We then map these values anf propagate the errors if needed.

// form back from the JSON value.
// From that we get a stream of chat result values, which is why
// our return type is a stream of chat results.

// The function itself is not really asynchronous.
// The only thing asychronous about it, is the fact that
// we return a stream which is asynchronous.
